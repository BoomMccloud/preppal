### Model-by-Model Breakdown

#### 1. `User`

- **Purpose:** Stores user identity and profile information.
- **Design:** This is a standard user model that is fully compatible with the NextAuth.js Prisma adapter.
- **Relations:** A `User` can have many `Interview` sessions.

#### 2. `Interview`

- **Purpose:** This is the central model that represents a single interview session.
- **Key Fields:**
  - `status`: An `enum` is used to strictly control the state of the interview. This is crucial for your application logic (e.g., showing a "Resume" button for `IN_PROGRESS` interviews).
  - `startedAt` / `endedAt`: These nullable timestamps are more precise than `createdAt` for tracking the actual duration of the live call.
  - `userId`: A foreign key that creates a mandatory link to the `User` model. `onDelete: Cascade` means if a user is deleted, all their interviews are deleted too.
- **Relations:**
  - Belongs to one `User`.
  - Can have one `InterviewFeedback` (the `?` makes it optional).
  - Can have many `TranscriptEntry` records.

#### 3. `InterviewFeedback` ("Interview Results")

- **Purpose:** To store the post-interview analysis and results generated by the AI.
- **Design:** We've separated feedback from the main `Interview` model. This is a good practice because:
  1.  Feedback is only generated _after_ the interview is `COMPLETED`.
  2.  It keeps the `Interview` model lean and focused on the session's metadata.
  3.  In the future, feedback generation could become a slow, asynchronous process, and this separation supports that.
- **Key Fields:**
  - `summary`: A high-level summary of the interview.
  - `strengths`: Positive feedback points, presented as a markdown list.
  - `contentAndStructure`: Feedback on the substance and organization of answers.
  - `communicationAndDelivery`: Feedback on verbal communication style, pacing, and clarity.
  - `presentation`: Feedback on non-verbal cues like eye contact and posture, derived from video analysis.
- **Relations:** Has a strict one-to-one relationship with `Interview`. The `@unique` constraint on `interviewId` ensures one interview can never have more than one feedback report.

#### 4. `TranscriptEntry`

- **Purpose:** To store the full, turn-by-turn transcript of the conversation.
- **Design:** Storing each spoken part as a separate row is far more scalable than saving the entire transcript as a single text blob or JSON object in the `Interview` model. This design allows you to:
  - Easily render the conversation in the UI.
  - Query for specific things said by the user or AI.
  - Potentially run further analysis on individual parts of the conversation.
- **Key Fields:**
  - `speaker`: An `enum` (`USER` or `AI`) makes it unambiguous who is speaking.
  - `timestamp`: Essential for reassembling the conversation in the correct order.
  - `content`: The actual text that was spoken.
- **Relations:** Each entry belongs to a single `Interview`. The `@@index` on `interviewId` and `timestamp` makes fetching and sorting the transcript for a given interview very fast.
