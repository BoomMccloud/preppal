I've been working primarily with React and TypeScript, and I'm really passionate about building user-friendly, performant web applications. What attracted me to this role is the opportunity to work on challenging problems with modern technologies and the chance to mentor other developers.",

    {
      speaker: "USER",
      content: "Sure! The main challenge was that our application had grown organically over time, and we had accumulated a lot of technical debt. Bundle sizes were huge, we had unnecessary re-renders, and the code was difficult to maintain. I started by doing a thorough audit using tools like Lighthouse and React DevTools Profiler. Then I created a roadmap with the team to address issues incrementally - we implemented code splitting, migrated to React Query for data fetching, and introduced memoization where needed. The key was making sure we didn't disrupt ongoing development while making these improvements.",

    {
      speaker: "AI",
      content: "Excellent approach! Now let's dive into a technical question. Can you explain the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering, and when you might choose one over the other?",
      timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 3300000),
    },
    {
      speaker: "USER",
      content: "Great question. Client-side rendering is when JavaScript runs in the browser to render the page. This is typical in traditional React apps - you get a minimal HTML shell, then JavaScript builds the UI. It's great for highly interactive applications but can have slower initial load times and SEO challenges. Server-side rendering generates the full HTML on the server, sending complete pages to the browser. This is faster for initial page loads and better for SEO. With Next.js, we can actually use both - SSR for initial loads and then hydrate to a fully interactive client-side app. I'd choose SSR for content-heavy sites where SEO matters, and CSR for dashboard-type applications where SEO is less critical.",
      timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 3240000),
    },
    {
      speaker: "AI",
      content: "Perfect explanation! Let's do a quick coding exercise. Can you write a custom React hook that debounces a value? For example, if I'm typing in a search box, I want to wait until the user stops typing before making an API call.",
      timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 3120000),
    },
    {
      speaker: "USER",
      content: "Absolutely! Here's how I'd implement that:\n\nfunction useDebounce(value, delay) {\n  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handler = setTimeout(() => {\n      setDebouncedValue(value);\n    }, delay);\n    \n    return () => {\n      clearTimeout(handler);\n    };\n  }, [value, delay]);\n  \n  return debouncedValue;\n}\n\nThe key is using useEffect with the value as a dependency, setting a timeout to update the debounced value, and cleaning up the timeout on each render. This way, if the value changes before the delay expires, we cancel the previous timeout and start a new one.",
      timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 3000000),

      speaker: "AI",

      timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 2820000),
    },
    {
      speaker: "AI",
      content: "Great question! Our frontend team has 8 engineers, and we work very closely with 4 backend engineers and 2 designers. We do weekly syncs between all teams, and we use pair programming for complex features. The team really values collaboration and knowledge sharing. Well, that wraps up our interview today!
