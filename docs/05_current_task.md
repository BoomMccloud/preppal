# Current Task: Fix Authentication Routing Issue

## Problem
User can login via `/api/auth/signin` but when visiting dashboard, gets redirected to `/signin` instead of `/api/auth/signin`.

## Plan
1. Investigate routing and authentication flow
2. Find where custom signin page is configured
3. Fix signin page redirect configuration
4. Test the fixed routing

## Status
- [x] Investigate routing and authentication flow
- [x] Fix signin page redirect
- [x] Test the fixed routing
- [x] Debug CredentialsSignin error

**COMPLETED** ✅

## Changes Made
1. **Created custom signin page** with proper NextAuth integration
2. **Added client-side form** for development credentials with pre-filled values
3. **Fixed auth configuration** to use custom signin page (`/signin`)
4. **Added debug logging** to credentials provider for troubleshooting
5. **Implemented proper error handling** in the signin form

## Goal
Ensure users are properly redirected to the correct NextAuth signin page when authentication is required.
