# App Router Structure (Next.js)

This document details the frontend architecture of the Preppal application, which is built using the Next.js App Router.

## App Router Structure

### Core Files

- **`layout.tsx`**: This is the root layout of the application. It defines the global HTML structure, including `<html>` and `<body>` tags. It's used to wrap all pages and can provide a consistent header, footer, or sidebar.

- **`page.tsx`**: This is the main page of the application, rendered at the root URL (`/`). It serves as the user's dashboard and is a React Server Component (RSC), allowing it to fetch data directly on the server.

### Components (`_components/`)

- The `_components/` folder is a convention for storing components that are used within the `app` directory but are not themselves routes. The leading underscore prevents Next.js from treating the folder as a route segment.

- This directory contains the primary UI components for the interview session, such as `AudioVisualizer`, `InterviewControls`, and `TranscriptDisplay`, as well as shared components like `Navigation` and `ThemeToggle`.

### API Routes (`api/`)

- This directory contains the API endpoints for the application.
  - **`auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`**: This is the NextAuth.js route handler, which manages all authentication-related requests (e.g., sign-in, sign-out, session management).
  - **`trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`**: This is the tRPC route handler, which exposes the tRPC API to the client.

## React Server Components (RSC) vs. Client Components

- **Server Components**: The default in the App Router. They run on the server and can directly access server-side resources like the database. `page.tsx` is an example.
- **Client Components**: Opt-in with the `"use client";` directive. They are rendered on the client and can use React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for interactivity. Most components in `_components/` are Client Components.

## Data Flow

1.  **Server-side**: The root `page.tsx` (RSC) can fetch initial data directly using the tRPC server client.
2.  **Hydration**: This server-fetched data is passed to client components. The `<HydrateClient>` component (in `src/trpc/react.tsx`) is used to hydrate the `react-query` cache on the client, making the data available without an additional client-side fetch.
3.  **Client-side**: Client components can then use tRPC's React Query hooks to fetch data or perform mutations on the client, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
